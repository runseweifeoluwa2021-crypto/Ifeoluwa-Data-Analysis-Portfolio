# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!

2. [Jurmot Dashboard](02_Jurmot_Dashboard/README.md) – Visualized key metrics and insights for Jurmot Enterprise using dashboard reports.  
3. [Wase Ltd Dashboard](03_Wase_Dashboard/README.md) – Interactive dashboard showing performance metrics and trends.  
4. [Supplement Drug Sales](04_Supplement_Drug_Sales/README.md) – Analyzed sales data to identify top-performing products and sales patterns.  
5. [Imprest and Expense AppSheet – Agboyi Ketu](05_Imprest_Expense_AppSheet/README.md) – Tracked expenses and cash flow through a simple AppSheet application.
